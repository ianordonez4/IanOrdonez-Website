        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! My name is Ian Ordonez and I am currently a first year political science/Public service major at the University of California Riverside. Prior to attending UCR I attended Mark Keppel High School where I was captain of the varsity volleyball team, a two time ALL-League selction, one time MVP slection, and one time honorable mention All-League selection. Along with that I was also a member of the Associated Student Body. After graduation I remained a prominent figure in my school's volleyball program by coaching the varsity boys team in their summer league tournaments before I headed off to college. Having played volleyball for almost 10 years I knew that one day I would want to coach a team of my own and hopefully inthe future I can coach at the college level, but I knew that this was a good starting point to being my coaching career. <br><br>

         It was during high school that I discovered my passion for politics. I grew up in a rather political household and was exposed to it a ta very young age, but it wasn't until I grew up a little bit and finally started to see that world from a different perspective. Right around the time I started applying to colleges I knew that political science would be the major for me. Although I didn't get accepted into the most prestigious schools I know that my foundation will be strong after leaving UCR with my degree and perhaps going to graduate school elsewhere to further my expertise.<br><br>

        This past summer I had one of the best opportunities that an incoming college student could have. I was selected to be an intern with the State Senator Bob Archuleta of my home district. At first I was very timid and nervous, but as time went by I knew that this is where I was supposed to be. At the Senators office I had many duties, I was in charge of the program known as LCMS, the Legislative Constituent Management System, which basically allows the senator's constituents to reach out and express any grievances, support, or how they would like him to vote in his upcoming session. I was responsible for sorting all of these messages, and presenting the data to staff. I was also tasked with responding to any constituents that wanted to meet with the Senator or had any dire situations that required immediate government official help. Other than LCMS I answered phones, dealt with mail, served as a liaison between the cities within the district and the Senator's office, and wrote letters to constituents. Overall, this opportunity gave me a first-hand look of the California state legislature, and being able to be apart of an office and work for an elected official was a dream come true. It further solidifed my choice to major in political science and hopefully one day I can return as a full time employee when I graduate with my degree.
